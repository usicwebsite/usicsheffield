# Next.js Deployment Error Prevention Guidelines
Apostrophes in JSX/TSX Files: Always use &apos; instead of single quotes (') in text content within JSX/TSX files
Example: You&apos;ll instead of You'll
This applies to all user-facing text, including headings, paragraphs, and button labels

Dynamic Imports in Next.js: When using dynamic imports, avoid variable names like module or chapterModule
Instead, use descriptive names that don't conflict with reserved words:
;

Image Component Usage: Always use Next.js's Image component from next/image instead of HTML <img> tags
Include all required props: src, alt, and either width/height or fill
