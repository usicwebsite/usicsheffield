Who We Are

Founded in 1964, USIC represents Muslim students on campus and beyond by providing social and welfare support. We provide a platform for students to learn more about Islam as well as opportunities to put their faith into action. Whatever may your background, faith or current beliefs be, everyone is welcome! 

We aspire:

    To provide a forum where Muslim students can meet, get to know each other and form bonds of brotherhood & sisterhood through organising various educational sports, and charity events.
    To organise events that allow both Muslims and non-Muslims to gain deeper knowledge and understanding of Islam.
    To look out for the welfare of Muslim students on campus, whilst raising awareness of any issues affecting the Ummah, both nationally and internationally.

Our values

At the heart of USIC, we uphold the following values that define our identity and guide our actions.

    Faith: We stand united in unwavering faith, cultivating a deep connection with our Creator as the cornerstone of our individual and collective journeys.
    Brotherhood & Sisterhood: We foster a familial bond, embodying the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood. In our diverse community, we find strength, support, and genuine care for one another.
    Knowledge and Education: Rooted in the pursuit of knowledge, we commit ourselves to intellectual growth and the understanding of Islam. Through various educational initiatives, we aim to empower the minds and the hearts.
    Community Service: Guided by the principles of compassion and service, we actively engage in initiatives that uplift the broader community. Our actions echo the essence of selfless giving, rooted in Islamic teachings.
    Islamic Etiquette: We aspire to embody the values of courtesy and respect, ensuring that our interactions – both within the society and beyond – reflect the highest standards of Islamic etiquette. We strive towards echoing the noble character of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

In harmonising these values, we aspire to create an inclusive and dynamic environment for all – where faith flourishes, bonds strengthen, knowledge illuminates, service transforms, and our conduct reflects the beauty of Islamic ethics – making a positive impact on the university and on the wider community.
